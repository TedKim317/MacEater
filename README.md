# MacEater
A Mac version of trojan virus, or something similar. yeah, sort of that

It could...

Quit unsaved work (office 365)
Spam you
Encrypt your files(of course you could decrypt them, or just select a particular file. You could press cmd a or select your whole home folder for more fun, which this part is dangerous)
Delete important files (you could recover of course)
see you (just for surprising:) I dont actually have access to your camera
won't kill your device (I am afraid to do that for your safety + I dont have enough tech skills)
Spam you with strange sound effects
set your desktop backgrounds default one
